## 1. ANOVA Table and Related Test
```{r}
anova(fit)
alpha=0.05
n=nrow(data0120)
qf(1-alpha,1,n-2)
#critical value of F_1,n-2, with alpha=0.05
```

## 2. We Seek a Descriptive measures of How Well the Fitted Model Explains the Observed Response. 
* \[R^2=\frac{SSR}{SST}=1-\frac{SSE}{SST}\]
* $R^2$ is the proportion of total variation in the response that is explained by the model. 
* \[0\leq R^2 \leq 1\]
* $R^2$ is not an estimate of any parameter, but rather a descriptive number about the **goodness of fit** of a model.
* An $R^2$ value of 1 implies a perfect fit of the observed data to the line. That is, all the points fall perfectly on a line.
* An $R^2$ value of 0 does not imply there's no relationship, just that there's no linear relationship. There could be nonlinear relationship. Plot your data to avoid this misinterpretation. 
* $R^2$ does not tell us the directiion of the relationship (whether it's positive or negative)

### a. Compute SST, SSR and $R^2$ using R.
\[SST=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2\]
```{r}
SST=sum((data0120$minutes-mean(data0120$minutes))^2)
SST
```
\[SSR=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\hat{Y_i}-\bar{Y})^2\]
```{r}
SSR=sum((fit$fitted.values-mean(data0120$minutes))^2)
SSR
```
 \[R^2=\frac{SSR}{SST}\]
```{r}
Rsq=SSR/SST
Rsq
summary(fit)#compare with the summary(fit)
```
**Interpretation:** 95.75% of the total variation in minutes can be explained by a linear relationship with copiers_number.


### b. Coefficient of Correlation, $r=\pm \sqrt{R^2}$.
* The sign is determined by the slope of the regression equation. 
* $r$ does not have any particular interpretation in regression. It is simply a measure of the fit of the linear regression model.
* \[-1\leq r \leq 1\]
* Relationship between $b_1$ and $r$: $b_1=r\sqrt{\frac{S_{YY}}{S_{XX}}}$.
